### Introduction

This page provides data access to the *Support Vector Machines Democracy
Indicator (SVMDI)* as proposed by Gründler and Krieger (2016) in the
[European Journal of Political
Economy](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268016300222).

The approach exploits Support Vector Machines (SMVs), a mathematical
algorithm for pattern recognition, which is a nonlinear generalization
of the Generalized Portrait algorithm. Using this new algorithm enables
computation of a detailed measurement of democracy. The main advantage
is that the aggregation strategy of the underlying attributes is not
arbitrary (as is typically the case, not only with regard to democracy
indices), but is transferred to a nonlinear optimization problem.
