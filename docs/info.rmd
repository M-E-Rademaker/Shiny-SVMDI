### Introduction

This page provides data access to the *Support Vector Machines Democracy Indicator (SVMDI)* as 
proposed by @Gruendler2016 in the [European Journal of Political Economy](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268016300222).

The approach exploits Support Vector Machines (SMVs), a mathematical algorithm for pattern recognition, 
which is a nonlinear generalization of the Generalized Portrait algorithm. Using this new algorithm 
enables computation of a detailed measurement of democracy. The main advantage is that the aggregation 
strategy of the underlying attributes is not arbitrary (as is typically the case, not only with 
regard to democracy indices), but is transferred to a nonlinear optimization problem.
